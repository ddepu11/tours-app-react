You will have free time to enter one of the pyramids (additional cost), though your guide is not permitted to enter with you, or take a camel ride (additional cost). After visiting the pyramids, you'll continue across the plateau for a photo opportunity of the three pyramids rising from the sands, with the Cairo skyline in the background. A short drive to the city side of the plateau finds you standing at the feet of the Sphinx, for thousands of years the enigmatic symbol of Egypt. Also in Giza you may visit the Solar Boat Museum (optional), home to the remarkably well preserved funerary boat of Khufu. Your next stop is Sakkara, home of Egypt's oldest pyramid, built in 2650 B.C. Your guide will provide a brief history of the famous Step Pyramid and you'll have free time to walk around. Your final stop is Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt. Here you will see artifacts from many of the great rulers of Egypt, including the fallen statue of Ramses II. You will also have the chance to visit a Papyrus Institute to see how the famous artwork is made.\",\r\n    image:\r\n      \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3689859/pexels-photo-3689859.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\r\n    price: \"85,000\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: \"7854asjjHIUYnka5\",\r\n    name: \"Get to know one of the wonder, Taj Mahal\",\r\n    info:\r\n      \"The Taj was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. The death of Mumtaz left the emperor so heartbroken that his hair is said to have turned grey virtually overnight. Construction of the Taj began the following year; although the main building is thought to have been built in eight years, the whole complex was not completed until 1653. Not long after it was finished, Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb and imprisoned in Agra Fort, where for the rest of his days he could only gaze out at his creation through a window. Following his death in 1666, Shah Jahan was buried here alongside his beloved Mumtaz,In total, some 20,000 people from India and Central Asia worked on the building. Specialists were brought in from as far away as Europe to produce the exquisite marble screens and pietra dura (marble inlay work) made with thousands of semiprecious stones.\",\r\n    image:\r\n      \"https://images.pexels.com/photos/2387871/pexels-photo-2387871.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\",\r\n    price: \"52,000\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: \"544578dfeewrpoiwJHJ\",\r\n    name: \"Bangkok Day Tour: Thai Foodie Tour and Cooking Class (half day)\",\r\n    info:\r\n      \"Duration: 4 hours Meeting Point: 8:40am at Silom Thai Cooking School Finish Point: Silom Thai Cooking School Itinerary: After meeting your chef, head to the bustling outdoor market and collect the ingredients needed to make your own authentic 5-course Thai cuisine. Your chef guide will explain the local foods and show you how Bangkok bargaining is done. After the market, return to the cooking school and get hands-on experience as you transform those ingredients into a masterpiece. You'll concoct curry paste, the most important part of all Thai dishes, from scratch by grinding the fresh herbs and spices in a stone mortar, releasing a wonderful aroma. Also learn how to make coconut milk and correctly cook rice to that perfect consistency. The main courses will vary by day, but each class instructs the making of a soup, salad, appetizer, main-course, and dessert. At the end of the class, enjoy your creation for lunch. And you get to keep the recipes!
